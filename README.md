# SharedHealth Speedrun Edition (1.21.4)

A fork of [Neddslayer's SharedHealth](https://github.com/Neddslayer/sharedhealth) mod with extensive speedrun and challenge features.

## Why This Fork Exists

I found the original SharedHealth mod and noticed it skipped 1.21.4, so I thought "how hard could it be to port it?" Well, after successfully porting it, I started adding features my friends and I wanted for our speedrun challenges. One thing led to another, and it evolved into this speedrun-focused hybrid. So if you like this kind of stuff feel free to use it.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: This mod includes AUTO WORLD DELETION features for speedrun resets. Read carefully before using!** ‚ö†Ô∏è
